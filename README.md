# My Learnings

This single repo contains some of the little projects I've made while learning some tools, frameworks or technologies. The idea came late so a lot of things I made are not featured here and they're lost or in other repos. I'm planning on moving some of those low value other repos inside of this one.

* [Cards](./elixir_cards/). <img src="./icons/elixir.svg" height="16px"/> Series of Elixir functions to generate and use a deck of cards. Extremely basic project as a first approach to the language.
* [Discuss](./elixir_discuss/). <img src="./icons/elixir.svg" height="16px"/> Discussion forum with GitHub authentication built with Elixir on top of Phoenix. It has a REST API, Websocket communications and a server-side rendered frontend.
* [Identicon](./elixir_identicon/). <img src="./icons/elixir.svg" height="16px"/> Basic identicon generator amde with Elixir.

## Soon
Technlogies I plan to learn and will have a new project over here in the furure.
* Go
* GraphQL
* gRPC

## Disclaimer
All the technology icons used in this README come from [devicon.dev](https://devicon.dev/).
