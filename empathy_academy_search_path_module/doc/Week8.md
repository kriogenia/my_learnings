#Week 8

#2021-04-12
Today we had some meetings, and we showed our current progress alongside the front patyh.
Then we decided some possible improvements to make.
Changing the aggregation order was the first I decided to make.

#2021-04-13
I'll start making the new tests for the ordering.
Next step was be making the filters apply to other aggregations even if they are applied too.

It was fairly easy, so I dedicated the rest of the day to the SteamJoy project.

We were told to make a demo this friday, so I'll focus on that instead of the project.

#2021-04-15
I made some advancements with the demo, but it's not perfect yet, so I keep working on that and SteamJoy.

#2021-04-16
With the demo and the project out of the way I can finally work on the suggestions.
I was able to retrieve hard coded suggestions so on monday I'll be working on making it related to the request.
