# Project Journal

This journal will register day to day and week to week the development of this project.
This project is part of the Search Path of the Empathy internship.

The intended goal is to develop an API on Micronaut at the same time we learn about search.
We will use Elastic Search as the Search Engine and, at first, the IMDb database as the data pool.

The path is intended to be, at least, eight weeks long. I really want to start learning.
