#Week 6

##2021-03-09
Today we had three meetings.
First, a common Academy meeting, nothing special.
Then, we meet the search team to review how we did our scores of the previous week.
And last, we meet with the front team to know the next steps.
I'll be working with Raúl, so his front will display my search and the search of María.

This week our work will be to have the same outcome of the searches and work with Raúl to make the integration.
So we exchanged some info and repos and then I went to finish my queries implementation.

I also did add the ratings and votes to the request to follow closely their implementation.

First in the morning I gave a look to my partner front page to found some discrepancies.
We'll be dealing with them later once he deploys my API, until then I'll be making tests.
I have a lot to fix and even more to create. 
I made a branch to develop without forcing him to keep making pulls.

I implemented a way to search the top results with an empty query.
This way the opening page of Raúl will be able to show that top 10.

We got it, the front page is working with my search and damn, it feels good.
Now I can even test everything easier.

I found a mistake on my queries thanks to these tries, and I kinda fixed it.
The rest of the time I've been developing tests.
