# Week 1

## 2021-03-01
I start the journal now as I forgot to the past week.
Our assignment the first week was to deploy a docker with ElasticSearch on our computers and a new Micronaut project.
Then we would do a pretty basic API giving back the query entered, and the ES version.

It was pretty simple at first, just create a basic controller that communicated with ES and returned a basic answer.
It was that easy that I focused more time on working on making a simple JSON serialization and deserialization.

Our path owner told us to also create a test for our simple call which I did, and it came very handy when I started to 
change a lot of, so I was able to easily test that I didn't break anything.

We all thought that it was just a simple exercise, but it was not. 
We will build from that so that first implementation is key to make our things easier.
So the whole week we were receiving tips from our path owner about our design.
They were pretty insightful and easily gave us the hints to enter the needed patterns.

And so on I did finish that assignment as he wanted to.
I'm pretty proud of how I did manage the exceptions and the dependency injection.
