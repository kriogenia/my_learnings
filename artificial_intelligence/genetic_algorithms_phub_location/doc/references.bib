  abstract = {This paper reports a new formulation of a general hub location
              model as a quadratic integer program. Non-convexity of the
              objective function makes the problem difficult. A variety of
              alternative solution strategies are discussed. Computational
              results from two simple heuristics are presented for the task of
              siting 2, 3 or 4 hubs to serve interactions between sets of 10, 15,
              20 and 25 U.S. cities. The effects of different computational
              shortcuts are examined. © 1987 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

  abstract = {Hub facilities serve as switching and transshipment points in
              transportation and communication networks. Hub networks concentrate
              flows on the hub-to-hub links and benefit from economies of scale
              in interhub transportation. Most hub location research has focused
              on problems where each origin/destination is allocated to a single
              hub. However, multiple allocation to more than one hub is necessary
              to minimize total transportation costs. This paper defines a p-hub
              median, analogous to a p-median, and presents integer programming
              formulations for the multiple and single allocation p-hub median
              problems. Two new heuristics for the single allocation p-hub median
              problem are evaluated. These heuristics derive a solution to the
              single allocation p-hub median problem from the solution to the
              multiple allocation p-hub median problem. Computational results are
              presented for problems with 10–40 origins/destinations and up to
              eight hubs. The new heuristics generally perform well in comparison
              with other heuristics.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the capacitated
              hub-and-spoke network design problem in which hubs have limited
              capacity for channelling flows between the nodes served by the
              system. The problem is formulated under a networking policy
              allowing both direct (nonstop) and hub connected (one-hub-stop and
              two-hub-stop) services between the nodes. A branch and bound
              algorithm and a heuristic procedure partitioning the set of
              solutions on the basis of hub locations are presented. In both
              algorithms, after identifying a set of hub locations, the problem
              is reduced into a smaller routing problem. Subgradient optimization
              is then applied to a Lagrangian relaxation of the reduced problem.
              The model and the proposed algorithms were applied to the air
              transportation system using data on passenger flows between the top
              forty US cities in 1989 (accounting for 73.32% of the surveyed
              passenger flow). Computational results from 141 problems suggest
              that both algorithms are effective at finding good solutions to
              this problem. © 1994.},

  abstract = {A genetic algorithm is one of a class of algorithms that searches
              a solution space for the optimal solution to a problem. This search
              is done in a fashion that mimics the operation of evolution – a "
              population" of possible solutions is formed, and new solutions are
              formed by "breeding" the best solutions from the population's
              members to form a new generation. The population evolves for many
              generations; when the algorithm finishes the best solution is
              returned. Genetic algorithms are particularly useful for problems
              where it is extremely difficult or impossible to get an exact
              solution, or for difficult problems where an exact solution may not
              be required. They offer an interesting alternative to the typical
              algorithmic solution methods, and are highly customizable, which
              make them an interesting challenge for students.},
