  abstract = {This article describes a suite of linguistic modules for the
              Spanish language based on a pipeline architecture, which contains
              tasks for PoS tagging and Named Entity Recognition and
              Classification (NERC). We have applied run-time parallelization
              techniques in a Big Data environment in order to make the suite of
              modules more efficient and scalable, and thereby to reduce
              computation time in a significant way. Therefore, we can address
              problems at Web scale. The linguistic modules have been developed
              using basic NLP techniques in order to easily integrate them in
              distributed computing environments. The qualitative performance of
              the modules is close the the state of the art.},
