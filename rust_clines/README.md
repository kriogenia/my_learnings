# Clines

Clines (from CLI clones) is a project based on the book [Command-line Rust](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/command-line-rust/9781098109424/) from Ken Youens-Clark. It attempts to recreate partially some of the most common and famous UNIX commands using Rust.

* Next command: `head`
* List of replicated commands:
  - `cat` with `-n` and `b` flags.
  - `echo` with `-n`.
* Planned extensions:
  - `cat`: `-E`, `-s`
